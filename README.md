Once you start reading about investments and entering the investment world, you might end up hearing about ETFs, one of the most used investment instruments, being an easy entry to the market. You might also come across with some financial quotes. One in particular from Ken Fisher:

>**"Time in the market beats timing the market."**

And another one from Warren Buffet, one of the most successful investors:
>**“Our favorite holding period is forever.”**

These quotes come from the unpredictableness and volatility of the market and how it is unlikely for anyone to know what is going to happen short-term. Neverthless, you can expect that the market will grow long-term and use that to your advantage, despite all the volatility you might encounter.

In this analysis we'll make a deep dive into time in the market and find out **how long is long enough. How long should we wait to guarantee we don't see any red on our portfolio anymore.** We'll look into 5 different assets: **2 Exchange-Traded Funds (ETF), 1 Stock, 1 Cryptocurrency and 1 Commodity** and check how long it took to comeback from a negative return (breakeven) in the worst cases and how the percentage of negative returns changed over time, considering as well other factors as inflation.

Finally, we'll try to find out if there is a way to improve the chances of not getting negative returns or at least decrease the breakeven duration.

Consumer Price Index measures changes over time in the general level of prices of goods and services that households acquire for the purpose of consumption. They were originally introduced in some countries to increase wages for workers in order to balance the increase of the living costs (given by the CPI). Currently is used widely by governments and central banks as a macroeconomic indicator of inflation.

In this Tableau Visualization, we take a look on how much the inflation really affects european citizens and how much is lost to it. There is a deep dive to understand which categories affect the most and whether or not the minimum wage increases in order to attenuate the efects of inflation.
