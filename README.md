Once you start reading about investments and entering the investment world, you might end up hearing about ETFs, one of the most used investment instruments, being an easy entry to the market. You might also come across with some financial quotes. One in particular from Ken Fisher:

>**"Time in the market beats timing the market."**

And another one from Warren Buffet, one of the most successful investors:
>**“Our favorite holding period is forever.”**

These quotes come from the unpredictableness and volatility of the market and how it is unlikely for anyone to know what is going to happen short-term. Neverthless, you can expect that the market will grow long-term and use that to your advantage, despite all the volatility you might encounter.

In this analysis we'll make a deep dive into time in the market and find out **how long is long enough. How long should we wait to guarantee we don't see any red on our portfolio anymore.** We'll look into 5 different assets: **2 Exchange-Traded Funds (ETF), 1 Stock, 1 Cryptocurrency and 1 Commodity** and check how long it took to comeback from a negative return (breakeven) in the worst cases and how the percentage of negative returns changed over time, considering as well other factors as inflation.

Finally, we'll try to find out if there is a way to improve the chances of not getting negative returns or at least decrease the breakeven duration.
