Once you start reading about investments and hearing from someone they're getting good returns, you might start thinking about using some of the money you saved up to invest in the market to also get that slice of the returns you see people getting.

You end up hearing about ETFs, one of the most used investment instruments, being an easy entry to the market.

You might also come across with some financial quotes. One in particular from Ken Fisher:
>**"Time in the market beats timing the market."**

And another one from Warren Buffet, one of the most successful investors:
>**“Our favorite holding period is forever.”**

These quotes come from the unpredictableness and volatility of the market and how it is unlikely for anyone to know what is going to happen short-term. Neverthless, you can expect that the market will grow long-term and use that to your advantage, despite all the volatility you might encounter.

So yes, holding for a long period of time works, but that is not the scope of this analysis. We might give more arguments to back this up, but in the end **the goal is to find out how long is long enough. How long should we wait to guarantee we don't see any red on our portfolio anymore.**

To do this we'll look into 5 different assets: **2 Exchange-Traded Funds (ETF), 1 Stock, 1 Cryptocurrency and 1 Commodity**. We'll find out how long it took to comeback from a negative return (breakeven) in the worst cases and how the percentage of negative returns changed over time.

Investing should be a way to try to beat inflation, trying to keep or increase the value of our money over time, so we'll take a look into inflation and consider it as the reference to breakeven and check again the worst cases and the variation of the percentage of negative returns.

Finally, we'll try to find out if there is a way to improve the chances of not getting negative returns or at least decrease the breakeven duration.
